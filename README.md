# PROJECT ASSESSMENT

# Agenda:

Building an entirely new platform on AWS, including infrastructure, internal developer platform (IdP/Software Factory), and associated principles and processes. The platform will serve as the foundation for highly available, scalable, and secure application delivery and deployment. Components are developed as microservices to be deployed within Kubernetes clusters.


# 1) Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
# Business (Functional) Requirements
•	User-facing applications: Serve multiple business applications as microservices (HTTP/gRPC APIs, background workers, event processors).
•	Developer workflows: Self-service developer platform: git-based, automated CI/CD.
•	Multi-tenancy (logical): Support multiple teams/environments (dev/test/prod) with isolation.
•	Observability & troubleshooting: Centralized logs, metrics, traces; easy drill-down from alert to pod and code.
•	Security & Compliance: Encryption at rest/in transit, fine-grained access controls, audit logs for compliance.
# Technical (Non-functional) Requirements
•	Availability: 99.95%+ for platform control plane and critical services; application RTO/RPO defined per app (example RTO ≤ 15min for critical).
•	Scalability: Elastic scaling for request spikes; horizontal scaling of microservices.
•	Performance: SLOs per service (e.g., p95 latency < 300ms).
•	Cost efficiency: Use mix of on-demand, spot, Fargate to balance cost and reliability.
•	Security: Zero-trust networking within VPCs, IAM least privilege, secrets management.

# 2) Architecture Principles & Patterns
# Design Principles
•	AWS Well-Architected: Embrace Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization.
•	Infrastructure as Code: Terraform / AWS CDK for infra; Helm + Kustomize for K8s.
•	GitOps: ArgoCD / Flux for continuous delivery of K8s manifests.
•	Immutable infrastructure: Build artifacts (containers, AMIs) and deploy without in-place edits.
•	Least privilege & defense-in-depth: IAM roles, network segmentation, WAF, GuardDuty, etc.
•	Policy-as-Code: OPA/Gatekeeper for K8s admission policies; tfsec/Checkov for IaC scanning.


# Patterns
•	Microservices: Domain-driven decomposition, sidecar patterns for logging/telemetry.
•	API Gateway + Backend for Frontend: ALB/NLB + API Gateway where needed.
•	Event-driven: SNS/SQS or EventBridge for asynchronous decoupling.
•	Service Mesh (optional): AWS App Mesh or Istio for traffic management, mTLS.
•	Gang scheduling: Use Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler + node groups for spot/on-demand mix.


# 3) Capacity Planning & Sizing (recommended baseline)
These are starting estimates — refine with real load tests and business traffic profiles.

Example scenario: Platform supports 100 microservices, average 100 RPS total, peaks 1000 RPS.
•	EKS control plane: AWS managed (multi-AZ) — no sizing needed.
•	Worker nodes (baseline):
o	On-demand nodes: 3 × m6i.xlarge (4 vCPU / 16 GiB) for critical system pods (logging, monitoring, ingress).
o	Spot autoscaling group: start with 6 × m6i.xlarge spot nodes for app workload (scale out on demand).
o	Fargate: used for isolated team workloads or bursty jobs.
•	Cluster autoscaler / Karpenter: configure with min nodes = 3 on-demand + spot pools; max nodes = depends on peak (e.g., 50 nodes).
•	Pod density: assume average pod = 0.5 vCPU, 1.5 GiB -> one m6i.xlarge (~4 vCPU / 16GB) can host ~6–8 pods with overhead.
•	Databases:
o	Aurora (Postgres): writer + 2 readers; start with db.r6g.large, scale up; multi-AZ.
o	Redis (ElastiCache): cluster with 2 × cache.m6g.large nodes (primary + replica) for session/cache.
•	Storage:
o	S3 for blobs and logs export; EFS (one per team/namespace) for shared files if needed.



# Autoscaling thresholds:
•	HPA on CPU 60% or request latency/p95 thresholds.
•	Cluster scaling policies react to pending pods and node utilization.

# 4) Clear Architecture Layers (logical)
# A. Networking Layer
•	VPC: Multi-AZ VPC with private and public subnets per AZ.
•	Subnets: Private for EKS workers and DB, public only for NAT/load balancers.
•	Transit: Transit Gateway for multi-account connectivity (hub-and-spoke).
•	Security: NACLs minimal; Security Groups per tier; VPC Endpoints for S3, ECR, Secrets Manager.
•	DNS: Route 53 (private hosted zones per environment) + public for public endpoints.
# B. Compute Layer
•	EKS clusters (separate clusters per environment or multi-tenant cluster with namespace isolation).
•	EKS node groups: On-demand for infra, spot for apps, Fargate for workloads that require serverless.

o	Prod account(s) — production EKS clusters, prod DBs.
o	Non-prod accounts — dev, staging, sandbox (each with own EKS cluster or shared cluster with strict namespace isolation).
o	Security account — GuardDuty aggregation, Security Hub, centralized audit logs (CloudTrail S3).
•	IAM / SSO: AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center) mapped to IdP (Okta/Azure AD), cross-account roles, SCPs for guardrails.

# II. Networking Layer
•	VPC (per-account or per-environment):
o	Multi-AZ, 3 AZs recommended.

o	Transit Gateway (hub) for connecting accounts, on-prem via VPN/Direct Connect.
o	VPC Endpoints: S3, ECR API (ecr.dkr), SSM, Secrets Manager — to avoid NAT costs and restrict traffic.
•	Route 53:
o	Public hosted zones for public endpoints.

# III. Compute & Container Orchestration

# EKS (Amazon managed):
o	One cluster per environment (recommended for isolation), or multi-tenant cluster per team with strict namespace RBAC & resource quotas.

# 	Node types:
	Managed Node Groups (on-demand) for critical infra pods (logging, monitoring).
	Spot Instance Node Groups for non-critical workloads.
	Fargate profiles for small bursty jobs or sandboxed workloads.

# 	Autoscaling:
	Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler to scale nodes.
	HPA/VPA for pod-level scaling (based on CPU/Memory/custom metrics such as request latency).

# 	Ingress & Service Mesh:
	AWS ALB Ingress Controller or Gateway API + optional App Mesh (for mTLS, observability).
o	IRSA: IAM Roles for Service Accounts to give least-privilege to pods.

# IV. Storage & Databases
•	Object storage: S3 (lifecycle policies, cross-region replication for backups).
•	Relational DB: Amazon Aurora (PostgreSQL) Multi-AZ; Aurora Global DB for multi-region DR.
•	Key-value / cache: ElastiCache Redis cluster (primary + replica), or Amazon MemoryDB if durability required.
•	NoSQL: DynamoDB for high-scale key-value.

# V. CI/CD & Internal Developer Platform
# 	Git (Source Control): GitHub Enterprise / GitLab / CodeCommit.
# 	CI:
o	Build/test in GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/Jenkins.
o	Container image scan (Trivy/Clair) in pipeline.
o	Unit, integration tests, SCA (Snyk) and license checks.

o	Promotion workflow: PR -> CI -> push image -> ArgoCD detects -> sync to cluster (with gating for prod).
•	Platform developer portal: Backstage for templates, service catalog, onboarding, and metrics.
# IaC pipeline: Terraform in CI with plan->policy-check->apply, locked by workspace and require approvals. Use Terraform Cloud/Enterprise or Atlantis for collaboration.

# VI. Observability & Telemetry
•	Metrics: Prometheus (k8s) + Thanos or remote-write to CloudWatch Metrics / Cortex for long retention.
•	Logging: Fluent Bit -> CloudWatch Logs and S3 for long-term retention; optionally forward to Elasticsearch/Opensearch for search.
•	Tracing: OpenTelemetry SDK -> Collector -> X-Ray / Jaeger.
•	Dashboards & Alerts: Grafana dashboards per service; Alertmanager -> Opsgenie/PagerDuty/Slack.
•	SLO/SLI: Define SLOs per service (latency/availability/error-rate), implement error/budget alerts.

# VII. Security & Compliance
•	Edge & DDoS: CloudFront + WAF + AWS Shield Advanced for important apps.
•	Threat detection: GuardDuty, Security Hub, Amazon Inspector for EC2/ECR scanning.
•	Secrets & Keys: Secrets Manager or Parameter Store (encrypted with KMS). KMS keys per account with key policies.
•	Compliance & Audit: Enable CloudTrail (organization trails replicated to central security account), Config rules, conformance packs.
•	Kubernetes hardening: OPA/Gatekeeper policies, PodSecurity admission, CIS Benchmarks hardened nodes, image signing (cosign).

# VIII. Operations & DR
•	Backups: RDS/EFS/EBS snapshot policies + S3 replication to secondary region.
•	DR strategy:
o	RTO/RPO matrix per service.
o	For critical services: active-active across regions or active-standby with Aurora Global DB.

# Upgrade strategy:
o	Argo Rollouts for app upgrades; managed nodegroup upgrade for nodes or version upgrades with controlled draining.
•	Runbooks & Playbooks: On-call runbooks for common alerts (DB failover, high latency, spikes, security incidents).
•	Game days: Scheduled DR tests and chaos engineering to validate assumptions.





# Sizing (starting baseline) — Example: 100 microservices, avg 100 RPS, peak 1000 RPS
•	EKS control plane: managed by AWS.
•	Worker nodes:
o	Infra (on-demand): 3 × m6i.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16GB) — system-critical pods.
o	App pool (spot): start 6 × m6i.xlarge; allow autoscale to 30–50 nodes for peak.
o	Fargate: use for developer sandbox and lightweight workloads.
•	DB:
o	Aurora writer: db.r6g.large; readers db.r6g.large × 2 (scale as needed).
•	Cache: ElastiCache redis cache.t4.large × 2 (or m6g.large for production).
•	S3: object store sized per application needs; lifecycle to reduce cost.
•	Network: NAT Gateway per AZ (or VPC endpoints to reduce NAT egress).
These should be load-tested and refined. Use a cost model to simulate monthly spend across dev/stage/prod.
